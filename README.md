This is a [VjANDEP](https://vjandep.com) mobile-application project created with [`EXPO`](https://expo.dev), [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev), and [React-Native-Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com).

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

- Proper abstraction to the code
- Dynamically read Products through online (sheet / excel)
